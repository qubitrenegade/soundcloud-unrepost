README: SoundCloud Un-Repost Script
====================================

What is this?
-------------
This script automates the process of removing reposts from your SoundCloud profile.
It will go through your reposts one by one, click the "Unpost" button, and
confirm the action, effectively cleaning up your feed.

How to Use
----------
1.  Go to your SoundCloud reposts page (e.g., https://soundcloud.com/your-username/reposts).
2.  Open the Developer Console in your browser.
    - Chrome: `Ctrl+Shift+J` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Option+J` (Mac)
    - Firefox: `Ctrl+Shift+I` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Option+I` (Mac), then select the "Console" tab.
3.  Scroll down a bit on the page to load the first few tracks.
4.  Copy the ENTIRE code block below (from `(async () => {` to the final `})();`).
5.  Paste the code into the console and press `Enter`.
6.  The script will now run in the console tab. You can watch its progress there.

Configuration
-------------
Before you run the script, you can change the settings below to customize it.

- `EXCEPTIONS`: This is the most important part! It's a "keep list". Any repost
  that matches a term in this list will be SKIPPED. It uses regular expressions,
  which are flexible for matching text.

  **To add an exception, add a new line inside the `[]` brackets.**

  - To skip any track with the word "ArtistName" in it (case-insensitive):
    /ArtistName/i,

  - To skip a specific track title like "My Favorite Song (Remix)":
    /My Favorite Song.*Remix/i,

- `LIMIT`: A safety feature. This is the maximum number of reposts the script
  will remove. It's set to 10 by default to prevent accidents.
  Set to `Infinity` to remove all reposts (that don't match your exceptions).

Disclaimer
----------
This is an unofficial script and is shared for educational purposes only. It relies
on SoundCloud's current website structure, which can change at any time. If
SoundCloud updates its site, this script may stop working.

I originally created and used this script to help with my own rebranding and found
it helpful, so I'm sharing it in the hope that it might be useful to others.
However, it comes with absolutely no warranty, expressed or implied. Use it
entirely at your own risk.
